## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, **please do not open a public issue**.

Instead, report it privately using [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/AadityaMuley/antigravity-model-usage/security/advisories/new).

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgement**: within 48 hours
- **Status updates**: weekly until resolved
- **Fix timeline**: depends on severity, but we aim for patches within 7 days for critical issues

## Security Best Practices

- Never commit API keys, tokens, or credentials to the repository
- Report vulnerabilities privately before disclosing publicly
- Use the latest version of the extension for the most up-to-date security fixes
